# Grain hello world in a browser

This sample displays a simple hello world in the browser console.

Since there are no Grain Javascript bindings, this sample writes the message to the console.  
Keep an eye on [wit-bindgen](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen) as the Grain team adds support there.
